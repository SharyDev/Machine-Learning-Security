# Homomorphic Encryption in Machine Learning (HEML)

## Introduction
This project explores the application of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) within the realm of Machine Learning to enhance privacy-preserving capabilities. The focus is on implementing and evaluating various HE schemes, including the use of TenSEAL, a library designed for easy integration of HE with tensor operations in machine learning workflows.

## Project Objective
